## What is regex or Regular Expression in kotlin?

Imagine you have a big box with many toys. You want to find a specific toy, but you don't know exactly where it is. That's where regular expressions come in!

A regular expression is like a special pattern or rule that you can use to search for the toy you want. Just like how you can use different patterns to find different toys in the big box.

For example, you might say, "I want a toy that is red and round." That's a pattern or a rule. And using that pattern, you can easily find the red, round toy you're looking for.

In computer programming, regular expressions are used to search for specific text in a bigger text. Just like how you search for a specific toy in the big box.

So, regular expressions help you find the information you need in a quick and easy way!

In Kotlin, you can create regular expressions using the Regex class from the kotlin.text package.
